:Doxygen comments everywhere 
	- Automatically generate documentation
:VLFeat for non-GPU SIFT (add define ENABLE_OPENCL)
:Multithreading
	- Geometric verification
	- Homography estimation
:Shared calibration
	- User specified groups sharing calibration
	- Supply cameras with non-shared and shared parameters
	- When asking a camera for ceres::cost, tell them if we want version with shared parameters or not
:Rolling shutter
:Distortion division model
:Initialize camera
	- Run BA multiple times for the new camera and remove outliers in after the runs (remove only information that the points are seen by this camera)
	- Check for number of inliers in the end
	- Check if focal is >0.1*imgWidth in the end
:LM after triangulation? (just bundleAdjustPoints?)
:cmpmvs output
:Absolute pose
	- p3p
	- unknown f (square pixels)
:Matching - multithreading + GPU - use project from GPU course
:SFMTools - connect with YASFM
:Quaternions camera - test convergence and times
:Compile SIFTGPU for CUDA
:5pt verification for calibrated cameras?
:Angle thresholds instead of pixel based ones?
:USAC - implement
:Hartley's 5pt? - occasional bugs? - unit tests failing
:Matching - store dist ratios instead of dists - better prosac?
:Memoptim - run big dataset and fix issues (maybe that binary IO will be neccessary)
:Similarity - no exhaustive matching
