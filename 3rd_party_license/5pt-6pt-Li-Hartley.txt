Implementations included here are by (me) Richard Hartley. Please do
not think that this is my usual style of C coding. Please report any problems
with this code to me.  However, I would appreciate only receiving comments
pointing out mistakes, or clear improvements, but not requests for guidance
on what the Essential Matrix is, or what it might be good for.  To this
date, that question does not have a clear answer.
